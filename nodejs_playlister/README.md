# playlister
A web app that converts spotify playlists into youtube music video playlists

This project is mainly intended as a learning exercise, utilising nodejs, html and both the spotifiy and youtube API's a basic playlist converter can be created. To test you will need your own credentials from both API's.

An issue with the project, however, is that due to youtube's api quota limits the app very quickly exceeds the number of requests allowed by youtube in a give time frame (a day), so the app is not terribly useable in the real world and only serves to demonstrate knowledge of the techniques being used to create said app.

The implementation of the spotify api using fetCh may prove useful to some, as I noticed alot of people asking about how to do this when researching the project.
